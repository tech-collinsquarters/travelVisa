### Your Protection:

## ❌ DANGEROUS WORDS - Never Use These

### Absolute Guarantees:
- ❌ "Guaranteed approval"
- ❌ "100% approval rate"
- ❌ "Your visa WILL be approved"
- ❌ "We guarantee success"
- ❌ "Never get rejected"
- ❌ "Guaranteed acceptance"

**Why Dangerous**: Visa decisions are made by government, not you. You cannot guarantee outcomes.

**✅ Safe Alternatives**:
- "98% of our clients receive favorable outcomes*"
- "High success rate based on historical data*"
- "We'll work diligently for the best possible outcome"

### False Authority:
- ❌ "Official visa service"
- ❌ "Government-approved"
- ❌ "Official Australian immigration"
- ❌ "Authorized by the Australian government"

**Why Dangerous**: Implies government affiliation when you're independent.

**✅ Safe Alternatives**:
- "Professional visa consulting service"
- "Independent visa assistance"
- "Experienced visa consultants"

### Time Promises:
- ❌ "Visa approved in 24 hours guaranteed"
- ❌ "Instant visa approval"
- ❌ "Get your visa today"

**Why Dangerous**: You don't control government processing times.

**✅ Safe Alternatives**:
- "Most applications processed within 48-72 hours*"
- "Expedited service available*"
- "We submit applications promptly"

### Rejection Promises:
- ❌ "Never get rejected"
- ❌ "Zero rejection rate"
- ❌ "Rejection impossible"

**Why Dangerous**: Nobody has zero rejections.

**✅ Safe Alternatives**:
- "98% success rate based on past cases*"
- "Low rejection rate with expert guidance*"

### Money-Back Guarantees (Use Carefully):
- ❌ "100% money-back guarantee"
- ❌ "Full refund if rejected"

**Why Dangerous**: Can be legally binding without conditions.

**✅ Safe Alternative**:
- "Satisfaction guarantee - terms apply*"
- "Refund policy available - see terms*"
- "If we make an error, we'll work to make it right*"
