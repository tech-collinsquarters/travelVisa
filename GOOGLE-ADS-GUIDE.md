## 🎯 Google Ads vs Meta Ads: Key Differences

| Aspect | Google Ads | Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads |
|--------|------------|-------------------------------|
| **Intent** | HIGH - actively searching | MEDIUM - browsing, discovery |
| **Cost per Click** | $2-8 | $0.50-2 |
| **Conversion Rate** | 8-15% | 5-10% |
| **Best For** | Bottom of funnel, ready to buy | Top of funnel, awareness |

<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'AW-XXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

**Add conversion event** in js/main.js after form submission:

```javascript
// Google Ads Conversion Tracking
if (typeof gtag !== 'undefined') {
    gtag('event', 'conversion', {
        'send_to': 'AW-XXXXXXXXX/xxxxx',  // Your conversion ID
        'value': 1.0,

    });
}
